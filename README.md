# UberPrepared

## Inspiration

Have you ever wanted to call an Uber but couldn't because there was no data service? Or maybe you wanted an Uber to pick you up at the movie theater after a movie and wished you could order an Uber ahead of time? Well now you can!

## How it works

With UberPrepared, you can now be uber prepared to go wherever you need to go! We made use of the Twilio and Uber APIs to create an offline-capable uber ordering and scheduling system. Utilizing a finite state machine in the backend, you are able to fuzzy-search locations (e.g. Computer History Museum, or The Counter in Palo Alto) and use natural language to select a time to be picked up.
